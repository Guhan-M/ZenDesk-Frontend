# Zendesk Project

This project is a simple MERN stack application that functions as an apartment help portal. The public can raise tickets for various issues and view the status of their tickets using a service request (SR) number. Admin and super admin users can view and manage these requests, assigning them to the appropriate admin and closing them once resolved.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing ticket and user data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js to build the backend API.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for the backend server.



 ## Database Setup
Ensure you have MongoDB installed locally or provide a connection URI. Update the MongoDB connection settings in the backend configuration file.
